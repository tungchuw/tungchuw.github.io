Tumor-derived exosomes could potentially promote tumor metastasis through the delivery of metastasis-related molecules. However, the function and underlying mechanism of exosomal long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in lung cancer metastasis remain largely unclear.\n**Methods:**\nCell exosomes were purifed from conditioned media by diferential ultracentrifugation and observed using transmission electron microscopy, and the size distributions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Exosomal lncRNA sequencing (lncRNA-seq) was used to identify long noncoding RNAs. Cell migration and invasion were determined by wound-healing assays, two-chamber transwell invasion assays and cell mobility tracking. Mice orthotopically and subcutaneously xenografted with human cancer cells were used to evaluate tumor metastasis in vivo. Western blot, qRT‒PCR, RNA-seq, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the poten‑ tial mechanism. The level of exosomal lncRNA in plasma was examined by qRT‒PCR. MS2-tagged RNA afnity purif‑ cation (MS2-TRAP) assays were performed to verify lncRNA-bound miRNAs.\n**Results:**\nExosomes derived from highly metastatic lung cancer cells promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells with low metastatic potential. Using lncRNA-seq, we found that a novel lncRNA, lnc-MLETA1, was upregu‑ lated in highly metastatic cells and their secreted exosomes. Overexpression of lnc-MLETA1 augmented cell migra‑ tion and invasion of lung cancer. Conversely, knockdown of lnc-MLETA1 attenuated the motility and metastasis of lung cancer cells. Interestingly, exosome-transmitted lnc-MLETA1 promoted cell motility and metastasis of lung cancer. Reciprocally, targeting lnc-MLETA1 with an LNA suppressed exosome-induced lung cancer cell motility. Mechanistically, lnc-MLETA1 regulated the expression of EGFR and IGF1R by sponging miR-186-5p and miR-497-5p to facilitate cell motility.

It is urgent to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for targeting lung CSCs.\n**Methods:**\nWe computed the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of 1554 Reactome gene sets to identify the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi)-associated pathways using the genome-wide RNA sequencing data of 509 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Phenotypic effects of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 (USP5) on the CSC-like properties and metastasis were examined by in vitro sphere formation assay, migration assay, invasion assay, and in vivo xenografted animal models. Cycloheximide chase assay, co-immunoprecipitation assay, and deubiquitination assay were performed to confirm the effect of USP5 on the deubiquitination of β-catenin.\n**Results:**\nWe demonstrated that USP5 expression were positively correlated with the stemness-associated signatures and poor outcomes in lung cancer specimens. Silencing of endogenous USP5 reduced CSC-like characteristics, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, USP5 interacted with β-catenin, which resulted in deubiquitination, stabilization of β-catenin, and activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Accordingly, expression of USP5 was positively correlated with the enrichment score of the Wnt/TCF pathway signature in human lung cancer. Silencing of β-catenin expression suppressed USP5-enhancing sphere formation. Targeting USP5 with the small molecule WP1130 promoted the degradation of β-catenin, and showed great inhibitory effects on sphere formation, migration, and invasion. Finally, we identified a poor-prognosis subset of tumors characterized by high levels of USP5, Wnt signaling score, and Stemness score in both TCGA-LUAD and Rousseaux_2013 datasets.\n**Conclusions:**\nThese findings reveal a clinical evidence for USP5-enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling in promoting lung cancer stemness and metastasis, implying that targeting USP5 could provide beneficial effects to improve lung cancer therapeutics.\n","tags":null,"title":"Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 facilitates cancer stem cell-like properties in lung cancer by deubiquitinating β-catenin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sheng-Yen Hsiao","Shang-Mei Weng","Jenn-Ren Hsiao","Jia‑En Wu","Yi‑Ying Wu","*Chia-Hao Tung*","Wan-Lin Shen","Shu-Fang Sun","Wen-Tsung Huang","Cheng-Yao Lin","Shang-Hung Chen","Yuh‑Ling Chen#","Tse‑Ming Hong#","Jang-Yang Chang#"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675382400,"objectID":"a5eefc155a38d111b75fc3bd7e1dcc28","permalink":"https://tungchuw.github.io/publication/2023-02-03-paper-mir455/","publishdate":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-02-03-paper-mir455/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background:**\nLymph node and distant metastasis contribute to poor outcomes in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The mechanisms regulating cancer migration and invasion play a key role in OSCC.\n**Methods:**\nWe determined migration and invasion ability of OSCC by wound-healing assay, two-chamber transwell invasion assay and cell mobility tracking and evaluated tumor metastasis in vivo. Western blot (WB), qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, dual-luciferase reporter assays and nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation were performed to investigate the potential mechanism. Immunohistochimical (IHC) staining determined vimentin and PDZK1IP1 expression in OSCC tissues.\n**Results and conclusions:**\nIn this study, we determined that miR-455-5p was associated with lymph node metastasis and clinical invasion, leading to poor outcomes in patients with OSCC. MiR-455-5p promoted oral cancer cell migration and invasion and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We also identified a new biomarker, PDZK1IP1 (MAP17), that was targeted by miR-455-5p. PDZK1IP1 knockdown led to migration, metastasis, EMT, and increased transforming growth factor-β signaling in OSCC. In addition, miR-455-5p overexpression and PDZK1IP1 inhibition promoted collective OSCC cell migration. According to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and the NCKU-OrCA-40TN data set, miR-455-5p and PDZK1IP1 are positively and negatively correlated, respectively, with partial EMT score. High miR-455-5p expression was associated with high vimentin levels and low MAP17 H-scores. The patients with low MAP17 expression had higher rates of disease recurrence than did patients with high MAP17 expression, especially for patients with clinical invasion risk factors and low MAP17 expression. These results suggest that miR-455-5p suppresses PDZK1IP1 expression and mediates OSCC progression. MiR-455-5p and PDZK1IP1 may therefore serve as key biomarkers and be involved in regulating partial EMT in OSCC cells. PDZK1IP1 expression may also serve as an independent factor that impacts outcomes in patients with clinical risk factors for recurrence.\n","tags":null,"title":"MiR-455-5p suppresses PDZK1IP1 to promote the motility of oral squamous cell carcinoma and accelerate clinical cancer invasion by regulating partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi‑Ying Wu","I-Shan Hsieh","*Chia-Hao Tung*","Chen-Hsun Weng","Jia‑En Wu","Jau-Song Yu","Yuh‑Ling Chen#","Tse‑Ming Hong#"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646697600,"objectID":"3a2783c0d7f649ed08991d6273e84ac2","permalink":"https://tungchuw.github.io/publication/2023-03-08-paper-annexina2/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-03-08-paper-annexina2/","section":"publication","summary":"Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the underlying reason for tumor recurrence, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Aptamers are synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides that can specifically bind to various molecular targets.

We perform whole-cell-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (cell-SELEX) to screen DNA aptamers that specifically bound to lung CSCs, modeled by E-cadherin-silenced A549 cells. We develop a CSC-specific aptamer (AP-9R) specifically recognizing lung CSCs with high affinity and identify Annexin A2, a Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding protein, as its target. Annexin A2 expression was upregulated in lung CSCs and involved in cancer stemness. The expression of Annexin A2 was associated with signatures of stemness and metastasis, as well as poor clinical outcomes, in lung cancer in silico. Moreover, AP-9R decreased Annexin A2 expression and suppressed CSC properties in CSCs in vitro and in vivo. The present findings suggest that Annexin A2 is a CSC marker and regulator, and the CSC-specific aptamer AP-9R has potential theranostic applications for lung cancer.","tags":null,"title":"A novel DNA aptamer targeting lung cancer stem cells exerts a therapeutic effect by binding and neutralizing Annexin A2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["*Chia-Hao Tung*","Meng-Fan Huang","Chen-Hsien Liang","Yi-Ying Wu","Jia-En Wu","Cheng-Lung Hsu","Yuh-Ling Chen#","Tse-Ming Hong#"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"b31d53ee9a70a3b8853e1c11e6a3d154","permalink":"https://tungchuw.github.io/publication/2022-01-01-paper-catulin/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-01-01-paper-catulin/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background:**\nThe cytoskeletal linker protein α-Catulin has been shown to be important for tumor progression in various cancers.

A tight-junction protein, Claudin 1 (CLDN1), is a metastasis suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma. However, as a metastasis suppressor, the underlying molecular mechanisms of CLDN1 has not been well studied.\n**Methods:**\nThe signaling pathway regulated by CLDN1 was analyzed by Metacore software and validated by immunoblots. The effect of the CLDN1-EPHB6-ERK-SLUG axis on the formation of cancer stem-like cells, drug resistance and metastasis were evaluated by sphere assay, aldefluor assay, flow cytometry, migration assay, cytotoxicity, soft agar assay, immunoprecipitation assay and xenograft experiments. Furthermore, the methylation-specific PCR, pyrosequencing assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assay were used to study the epigenetic and RUNX3-mediated CLDN1 transcription. Finally, the molecular signatures of RUNX3/CLDN1/SLUG were used to evaluate the correlation with overall survival by using gene expression omnibus (GEO) data.\n**Results:**\nWe demonstrated that CLDN1 repressed cancer progression via a feedback loop of the CLDN1-EPHB6-ERK1/2-SLUG axis, which repressed metastasis, drug resistance, and cancer stemness, indicating that CLDN1 acts as a metastasis suppressor. CLDN1 upregulated the cellular level of EPHB6 and enhanced its activation, resulting in suppression of ERK1/2 signaling. Interestingly, DNA hypermethylation of the CLDN1 promoter abrogated SLUG-mediated suppression of CLDN1 in low-metastatic cancer cells. In contrast, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or vorinostat facilitated CLDN1 expression in high-metastatic cancer cells and thus increased the efficacy of chemotherapy. Combined treatment with cisplatin and trichostatin A or vorinostat had a synergistic effect on cancer-cell death.\n**Conclusions:**\nThis study revealed that DNA methylation maintains CLDN1 expression and then represses lung cancer progression via the CLDN1-EPHB6-ERK1/2-SLUG axis. Because CLDN1 enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy, CLDN1 is not only a prognostic marker but a predictive marker for lung adenocarcinoma patients who are good candidates for chemotherapy. Forced CLDN1 expression in low CLDN1-expressing lung adenocarcinoma will increase the chemotherapy response, providing a novel therapeutic strategy.\n","tags":null,"title":"DNA methylation maintains the CLDN1-EPHB6-SLUG axis to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy and inhibit lung cancer progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yao-Tsung Tsai","Chen-Hsien Liang","Jin-Hsuan Yu","Kuan-Chih Huang","*Chia-Hao Tung*","Jia-En Wu","Yi-Ying Wu","Chih-Hsien Chang","Tse-Ming Hong#","Yuh-Ling Chen#"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575590400,"objectID":"260a41717aa149026a0cd69b36a667d6","permalink":"https://tungchuw.github.io/publication/2019-12-06-paper-gal1/","publishdate":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-12-06-paper-gal1/","section":"publication","summary":"Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a pleiotropic homodimeric β-galactoside-binding protein with a single carbohydrate recognition domain.

These observations all emphasized Gal-1 as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we developed a novel Gal-1-targeting DNA aptamer (AP-74 M-545) and demonstrated its antitumor effect by restoring immune function. AP-74 M-545 binds to Gal-1 with high affinity. AP-74 M-545 targets tumors in murine tumor models but suppresses tumor growth only in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, not in immunocompromised non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in AP-74 M-545-treated tumor tissues. AP-74 M-545 suppresses T cell apoptosis by blocking the binding of Gal-1 to CD45, the main receptor and apoptosis mediator of Gal-1 on T cells. Collectively, our data suggest that the Gal-1 aptamer suppresses tumor growth by blocking the interaction between Gal-1 and CD45 to rescue T cells from apoptosis and restores T cell-mediated immunity.

Analyses of cohorts from two other groups confirmed that expression of miR-150-5p was associated with early relapse and poor survival of OvCa patients. Inhibition of miR-150-5p significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of OvCa cells and induced a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) phenotype.

This high mortality rate is attributed to the fact that most cases of ovarian cancer are detected at late stages when metastases are already present. Through microarray analysis, we previously demonstrated that castor zinc finger 1 (CASZ1) is up-regulated in EOC cells. In contrast to its role in EOC, CASZ1 functions a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma. Human CASZ1 is predominantly expressed in 2 alternatively spliced isoforms: CASZ1a and CASZ1b. In the present study, we investigated the role of CASZ1 in ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion and assessed the value of CASZ1 expression as a prognostic indicator of metastasis in human ovarian cancer. We used a lentivirus expressing CASZ1-shRNA and a plasmid expressing CASZ1 from a CMV promoter to knockdown and overexpress CASZ1, respectively, in the MCAS, RMUG-S, TOV21G, and A2780CP70 ovarian cancer cell lines. mRNA expression levels in tumor tissues and cell lines were measured using quantitative real-time PCR, and CASZ1 protein expression in EOC and paired metastatic tumor tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. We found that CASZ1 was highly expressed in EOC tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines and that CASZ1 knockdown suppressed cell migration and invasion in EOC cells. CASZ1a and CASZ1b exerted similar effects on cell migration and invasion in EOC cells. In addition, CASZ1 promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in EOC cells, and CASZ1 knockdown suppressed cancer metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, CASZ1 protein levels were elevated in human metastatic ovarian tumor tissues. Together, these results indicate that CASZ1 is a novel promoter of EOC metastasis and is highly up-regulated in metastatic EOC tumors.","tags":null,"title":"CASZ1 is a novel promoter of metastasis in ovarian cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
